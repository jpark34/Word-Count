Worked in a group of 3 people to implement a simplified MapReduce-style wordcount application. This project was meant to give us experience in writing multi-thread safe code and we did that through the use of the pthread library. More specifically the pthread mutex and the pthread condition variables. This application takes in a .txt file as input and will count the words that it finds and spit out the results in a separate .txt file.
